# Getting Started with Dinoparks

## Get libraries from npm

Start by running `npm install`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

# How I approached the problem

As I haven't worked with React before I watched a quick 30 minute video on the basics.\
I then started with the basic frontend, breaking it up into components.\
Next was declaring the required state variables.\
I then wrote the code to retrieve the data from Nudls.\
Next was implementing the logic for the data and zones.\
Final step was to make it look better.

# What would I do differently?

Spend more time on testing, to make sure all scenarios are catered for correctly.\
Use the localstorage or database to track longer periods of Nudls logs. Started with it but ran out of time.\
Spend more time on UI to add some nice to haves.

# What I learned?

React... Worked with Vuejs but not React.

# How I think the challenge can be improved

Let the candidate commit the code to a Github repository, this way you can see if the person can use git as well.
